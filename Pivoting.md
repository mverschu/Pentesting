<h4>Method 1: Pivot with SSH & ProxyChains</h4>

This method leverages SSH with dynamic port forwarding to create a socks proxy, with proxychains to help with tools that can't use socks proxies. You can leverage this tunnel two ways:

* In a tool, configure a SOCKS proxy and point it to the SSH tunnel. This works great in tools that support it like Burp.
* Run a command with proxychains, which tunnels data over the SSH proxy.

This method allows mostly complete access to the target network, with few limitations, and is generally my preferred way to access gated networks. It requires the following pre-conditions to leverage:

 * Access on target machine
 * SSH service running on target machine and reachable from the attacker machine.
 * A password compromise or writing of a public key for entry, to a user that allows remote SSH login.

Non-root accounts may limit some tools from working fully (such as nmap), when creating certain types of packets are root only activities.

<h5>Setting up the tunnel</h5>

    ssh -D 127.0.0.1:9000 -f -N pentester@10.10.10.10 -p 22

This will setup an SSH tunnel in the background on local port 9000. The -p option is just used for connecting to our Kali machine.

<h5>Setup ProxyChains</h5>

In /etc/proxychains4.conf (or similar depending on version), add the following to the end of the file:

    socks5 127.0.0.1 9000

Run commands:

    $ proxychains nmap -sV webgoat
    Nmap scan report for webgoat (224.0.0.1)
    Host is up (0.00027s latency).
    rDNS record for 224.0.0.1: all-systems.mcast.net
    Not shown: 998 closed ports
    PORT     STATE SERVICE    VERSION
    8080/tcp open  http-proxy
    9001/tcp open  jdbc       HSQLDB JDBC (Network Compatibility Version 2.3.4.0)
